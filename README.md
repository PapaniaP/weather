# Weather App

This is a simple weather app project created to learn JavaScript and API implementation. With this app, users can check the current weather conditions for a location by entering the city name.

## Features

- **Weather Information**: Retrieve current weather data for a specified location.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and intuitive interface for easy navigation.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- OpenWeatherMap API

## What I Learned

During the development of this weather app, I gained valuable experience and knowledge in the following areas:

### 1. JavaScript

- **Asynchronous Programming**: I learned how to work with asynchronous functions and the `async/await` syntax to fetch data from an external API (OpenWeatherMap) and update the user interface based on the retrieved data.

- **DOM Manipulation**: I improved my skills in manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update HTML elements and provide real-time feedback to the user.

- **Conditional Statements**: I used conditional statements to handle different weather conditions and display corresponding weather icons.

- **Event Handling**: I practiced event handling by adding a click event listener to the search button, which triggers the weather data retrieval process.

### 2. API Integration

- **OpenWeatherMap API**: I successfully integrated the OpenWeatherMap API into my project to retrieve weather data based on user input (city name) and display it in a user-friendly format.

- **API Key Management**: I learned how to securely manage API keys by storing them in a separate JavaScript file and accessing them as environment variables.

### 3. Error Handling

- **HTTP Status Codes**: I implemented error handling by checking for HTTP status codes returned by the API. In case of a 404 status code, I display an error message to the user.

### 4. Version Control

- **Git and GitHub**: For the first time, I utilized Git and GitHub to track changes to my project. Whether or not i did it well is up to you. :D

These are just some of the key skills and knowledge I acquired while working on this weather app project. I look forward to further enhancing my coding skills and tackling more complex projects in the future.
